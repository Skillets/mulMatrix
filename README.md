# mulMatrix
matrix multiplication project from COSC241

mulMatrix - calculates the product of two given matrixes, checks for compatibilties, and then calculates the product. 
Allows for creation of random matrixes for testing purposes.
quickSort - handmade quicksort algorithm for an array. 
given an array, randomizes the array, creates a partition for quicksorting, and then recursively sorts the array. Also includes method for printing out array.
Test - test program for the two classes. Creates two random matrixes for the test case and prints the results.
